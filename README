rshell:i
This program is a basic command shell called rshell. It is capable of running bash commands whos executables
can be found in /bin(such as "ls", "echo", and "pwd"to name a few).

Installing:
To install rshell run the following commands:
    1. git pull https://github.com/aorti017/rshell.git
    2. cd rshell
    3. make
Then, to run rshell run "bin/rshell"

Executing commands within the shell:
Commands in rshell can be executed one at a time or chained together using one of three connectors, those
connectors being "&&", "||", and ";".
To string together a series of commands that execute regradless of whether the command prior succeeded
use the ";" connecor.
Example:"ls -a; mkdir .secrets; ls -a"
To string together a series of commands that only execute if the command prior to it successfuly
executed use the "&&" connector.
Example: "touch test && echo "This is a test" > test && cat test"
To string together a series of commands that only execute if the command before it failed use the
"||" connector.
Example: "cat words.txt || touch words.txt"
To exit rshell enter the command "exit". This command has the capability of being executed within a
series of commands connected by any of the connectors.
Comments can be made by appending the comment after a "#" character within the command, anything after the
"#" is treated as a comment.

Bugs/Limitations:
1. If any connector is the first thing to appear in a command it is ignored, and no error is displayed.
2. Multiple consecutive connectors with out commands between them are ignored and no error is displayed.
3. Trailing connectors are ignored and no error is displayed.
4. Using connectors as part of or the parameter for a command may cause the command to not execte as instructed,
or not execute at all.
5. Can not mix connectors in a single command line.
